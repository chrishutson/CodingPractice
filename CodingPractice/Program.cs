Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");

//TODO:
//Brush up on the following:
//1. Linq: Specifically comparisons.  Linq comparison and one where you write you own compare method.
//2. Delegates: Write a delegate using the "Func" keyword.  Also just figure out delegates in general
//3. Generics: Write a method that accepts a generic as one of the method params.  
//4. SQL Aggregates: Can't really do that here!  But that's something I should really work on in general
